# Parallax Effect 
Parallax effect is a web design technique that creates an illusion of depth and motion by moving the foreground and background elements of a webpage at different speeds as the user scrolls down the page. This effect is achieved by using CSS and JavaScript to manipulate the position and perspective of elements on the webpage.

The parallax effect can create a dynamic and engaging user experience, drawing the user's attention to specific elements on the page and providing a sense of depth and movement. It is often used in storytelling websites, landing pages, and product showcases to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the webpage.
